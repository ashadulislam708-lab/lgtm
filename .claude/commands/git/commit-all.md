description: Commit all changes - push submodules separately, then push current directory without submodules, create PRs to dev
argument-hint: Optional commit message override (leave empty for AI-generated message)
---

You are a git workflow assistant. Your task is to commit and push changes on the **current branch**, handling submodules separately from the parent repo.

**Workflow summary:**
1. Validate branch (if on `dev` or `main`, ask user for a new branch name and create it)
2. Push deepest nested submodules first (`.claude/nestjs`, `.claude/react`, etc.), each on its own branch, create PR to `dev`
3. Push `.claude` itself **without nested submodule pointer changes**, create PR to `dev`
4. Push the parent repo **without `.claude` pointer changes**, create PR to `dev`

**Note:** Submodules and the parent repo are pushed independently. `.claude` is pull-only for nested submodules. Use `/commit` for main project only (no submodules at all).

## CRITICAL RULES (NEVER VIOLATE)

1. **NEVER push directly to `dev` or `main`** - All changes MUST go through PRs
2. **ALWAYS use a personal branch** - If on dev/main, ask the user for a branch name and create it
3. **ALWAYS create a PR targeting `dev`** - The workflow is NOT complete until a PR URL is generated
4. **ASK if on `main` or `dev`** - Use AskUserQuestion to get a branch name, then create it with `git checkout -b`. Never push directly to protected branches.
5. **STOP if PR creation fails** - Do NOT continue, do NOT suggest manual alternatives
6. **Commit submodules FIRST, separately** - Each submodule is pushed independently
7. **Parent repo excludes ALL submodule changes** - Never include submodule pointer updates in parent commit
8. **`.claude` excludes nested submodule changes** - Never include nested submodule pointer updates (nestjs, react, etc.) in `.claude` commit. `.claude` is pull-only for nested submodules.

## Branch Policy

- **Personal branches only** (e.g., `<your-name>`, `feature-xyz`) - Never commit on `main` or `dev`
- **PRs target `dev`** - All PRs merge into `dev`, not `main`
- **Use current branch if valid** - If on dev/main, ask user for a branch name and create it
- **Submodules are independent** - Each submodule pushes on its own branch (ask for branch name if on dev/main)
- **`.claude` is pull-only for nested submodules** - Never push nested submodule pointer changes from `.claude`

---

## Step 0: Branch Validation (CRITICAL)

Before any commit, validate the current branch:

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
```

### 0.1 Check for Detached HEAD

```bash
if [ -z "$CURRENT_BRANCH" ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Detached HEAD state detected"
  # STOP - Use AskUserQuestion to get branch name from user
fi
```

**If detached HEAD:** Use **AskUserQuestion** to ask the user for their branch name:
```
You are in detached HEAD state. What branch name would you like to use?
(e.g., your name, feature name, or ticket ID)
```

Then checkout/create and push:
```bash
git checkout -b <user-branch>
git push -u origin <user-branch>
```

### 0.2 Check for Protected Branches

```bash
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "main" ] || [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "dev" ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Cannot commit directly to '$CURRENT_BRANCH'"
  # Use AskUserQuestion to get branch name from user
fi
```

**If on `main` or `dev`:** Use **AskUserQuestion** to ask the user for their branch name:
```
You are on '$CURRENT_BRANCH' which is a protected branch.
What branch name would you like to use?
(e.g., your name, feature name, or ticket ID)
```

Then checkout/create and push:
```bash
git checkout -b <user-branch>
git push -u origin <user-branch>
CURRENT_BRANCH="<user-branch>"
```

### 0.3 Ensure `dev` Branch Exists

```bash
if ! git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/dev; then
  echo "Creating dev branch from main..."
  ORIGINAL_BRANCH="$CURRENT_BRANCH"
  git checkout main
  git checkout -b dev
  git push -u origin dev
  git checkout "$ORIGINAL_BRANCH"
  echo "✓ Created dev branch"
fi
```

### 0.4 Confirm Ready

```bash
echo "✓ Using branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
echo "✓ PR will target: dev"
```

---

## Step 1: Detect All Submodules

Dynamically discover all submodules registered in the repo:

```bash
git submodule status --recursive
```

This lists all submodules (including nested ones). Parse the output to identify:
- Submodule paths
- Their current commit status
- Whether they have changes (indicated by `+` prefix)

Also check:
```bash
git status
```

Look for any path showing `(modified content)` or `(new commits)` — these are submodules with uncommitted changes.

---

## Step 2: Push Submodules Separately (Deepest First)

For each submodule with changes, commit from **deepest to shallowest** (nested submodules before their parents).

### 2.1 For EACH Submodule with Changes:

```bash
cd <submodule-path>

# Check current branch
SUBMODULE_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Validate branch (ask for branch if on main/dev/detached)
if [ -z "$SUBMODULE_BRANCH" ] || [ "$SUBMODULE_BRANCH" = "main" ] || [ "$SUBMODULE_BRANCH" = "dev" ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Submodule '<submodule-path>' on invalid branch: $SUBMODULE_BRANCH"
  # Use AskUserQuestion to ask user for branch name
  # Then: git checkout -b <user-branch> && git push -u origin <user-branch>
  # Update SUBMODULE_BRANCH to the new branch name
fi

# Ensure dev exists in this submodule repo
if ! git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/dev; then
  ORIG="$SUBMODULE_BRANCH"
  git checkout main && git checkout -b dev && git push -u origin dev
  git checkout "$ORIG"
fi

# Stage and commit
git add -A
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>: <description of changes>

# Push to submodule's own current branch
git push origin "$SUBMODULE_BRANCH"

# Create PR targeting dev in the submodule repo (REQUIRED)
gh pr create --base dev --head "$SUBMODULE_BRANCH" --title "<type>: <description>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points describing the changes>

## Submodule

EOF
)"

# Verify PR was created
gh pr view "$SUBMODULE_BRANCH" --json url --jq '.url'

# Return to parent
cd <back-to-parent>
```

**STOP if PR creation fails for any submodule.**

### 2.2 Push `.claude` Submodule (WITHOUT Nested Submodule Pointers)

After all nested submodules under `.claude` (e.g., `nestjs`, `react`) are pushed, handle `.claude` itself.
**CRITICAL:** `.claude` must NOT include nested submodule pointer changes. It is "pull-only" for nested submodules.

```bash
cd .claude

# Check current branch
CLAUDE_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Validate branch (ask for branch if on main/dev/detached)
if [ -z "$CLAUDE_BRANCH" ] || [ "$CLAUDE_BRANCH" = "main" ] || [ "$CLAUDE_BRANCH" = "dev" ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Submodule '.claude' on invalid branch: $CLAUDE_BRANCH"
  # Use AskUserQuestion to ask user for branch name
  # Then: git checkout -b <user-branch> && git push -u origin <user-branch>
  # Update CLAUDE_BRANCH to the new branch name
fi

# Ensure dev exists in .claude repo
if ! git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/dev; then
  ORIG="$CLAUDE_BRANCH"
  git checkout main && git checkout -b dev && git push -u origin dev
  git checkout "$ORIG"
fi

# Stage all changes
git add -A

# EXCLUDE nested submodule pointer changes (pull-only for nested submodules)
NESTED_SUBMODULE_PATHS=$(git config --file .gitmodules --get-regexp path | awk '{ print $2 }' 2>/dev/null)
for nested in $NESTED_SUBMODULE_PATHS; do
  git reset HEAD "$nested" 2>/dev/null || true
done
git reset HEAD .gitmodules 2>/dev/null || true

# Verify no nested submodule pointer changes are staged
git diff --cached --name-only
# Confirm NO nested submodule paths (nestjs, react, etc.) appear in this list

# Skip if only submodule pointer changes existed (no .claude-own files changed)
STAGED_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only)
if [ -z "$STAGED_FILES" ]; then
  echo "ℹ️ No .claude-specific changes to commit (only nested submodule pointers). Skipping .claude push."
  cd ..
  # Continue to parent repo step
else
  # Commit .claude's own files only (no nested submodule pointers)
  git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>: <description of .claude changes>

  # Push to .claude's own current branch
  git push origin "$CLAUDE_BRANCH"

  # Create PR targeting dev in .claude repo (REQUIRED)
  gh pr create --base dev --head "$CLAUDE_BRANCH" --title "<type>: <description>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

  # Verify PR was created
  gh pr view "$CLAUDE_BRANCH" --json url --jq '.url'

  cd ..
fi
```

**STOP if PR creation fails for `.claude`.**

---

## Step 3: Stage and Commit Parent Repo (WITHOUT Submodules)

Back in the repo root, commit only the parent repo's own files. **Exclude all submodule paths.**

### 3.1 Detect all submodule paths to exclude:

```bash
# Get list of all submodule paths
SUBMODULE_PATHS=$(git config --file .gitmodules --get-regexp path | awk '{ print $2 }' 2>/dev/null)
```

### 3.2 Stage files excluding submodules:

```bash
git add -A

# Unstage every detected submodule path
for submodule in $SUBMODULE_PATHS; do
  git reset HEAD "$submodule" 2>/dev/null || true
done

# Note: .gitmodules is a tracked file and should be committed when changed
```

### 3.3 Verify no submodule changes are staged:

```bash
git diff --cached --name-only
# Confirm NO submodule paths appear in this list
```

If only submodule changes existed and no parent files changed, skip the parent commit and report that only submodules were pushed.

### 3.4 Create commit with proper message:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>(<scope>): <concise description>

<optional body explaining the "why">

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

**Type prefixes:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `docs:` - Documentation
- `test:` - Tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `style:` - Formatting, no code change

**Scope abbreviations:**
- Use folder name or meaningful short name
- Examples: `frontend`, `backend`, `mobile`, `api`, `docs`

If $ARGUMENTS is provided by the user, use it as the commit message.

---

## Step 4: Push Parent Repo and Create PR (MANDATORY)

### Push to current branch:

```bash
git push origin "$CURRENT_BRANCH"
```

### Create PR targeting dev:

```bash
gh pr create --base dev --head "$CURRENT_BRANCH" --title "<PR title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points describing the changes>

## Changes
- <list key changes>

**Note:** Submodules were pushed separately with their own PRs.

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
EOF
)"
```

### Verify PR was created (REQUIRED):

```bash
gh pr view "$CURRENT_BRANCH" --json url --jq '.url'
```

**If this command fails or returns empty: STOP immediately.**

---

## Step 5: Report Results

The workflow is ONLY successful if ALL of these are true:
- ✓ Each nested submodule (`.claude/nestjs`, `.claude/react`, etc.) with changes was pushed on its own branch
- ✓ Each nested submodule PR was created targeting `dev`
- ✓ `.claude` committed WITHOUT nested submodule pointer changes (pull-only)
- ✓ `.claude` PR was created targeting `dev` (if it had own-file changes)
- ✓ Parent repo committed WITHOUT `.claude` pointer changes
- ✓ Parent repo pushed to origin
- ✓ Parent repo PR created with valid URL

### Success Report Format:

```
✓ Workflow Complete

Nested Submodule PRs (pushed individually):
1. .claude/<submodule> → <PR URL>
2. .claude/<submodule> → <PR URL>

.claude PR (no nested submodule pointers):
<PR URL> (or "Skipped - no .claude-specific changes")
  - Branch: <branch>
  - Commit: <hash> - <commit message>

Parent Repo PR (no .claude pointer changes):
<PR URL>
  - Branch: <current-branch>
  - Commit: <hash> - <commit message>
  - Files: <count>
```

### Failure Report Format:

```
✗ Workflow Failed

Error: <error description>
Action Required: <what user should do>
```

---

## Error Handling

### STOP conditions (halt workflow immediately):
- **On `main` or `dev` branch** → Ask user for branch name, create it, then continue workflow
- **Detached HEAD** → Ask user for branch name
- **PR creation fails** → STOP, show error
- **Push fails** → STOP, show error
- **`gh` CLI not authenticated** → STOP, instruct user to run `gh auth login`
- **No changes detected** → STOP, inform user

### NEVER do these:
- ❌ Push directly to `dev` or `main` in ANY repo (parent or submodule)
- ❌ Include submodule pointer changes in the parent repo commit
- ❌ Include nested submodule pointer changes in `.claude` commit (pull-only)
- ❌ Push without creating a PR
- ❌ Report "success" if PR was not created
- ❌ Suggest "manual PR creation" as an alternative

---

## Important Notes

- **Use current branch if valid** - If on dev/main, ask user for a branch name and create it
- **PR is mandatory** - The workflow does not complete without a PR URL
- **Submodules push independently** - Each submodule gets its own push and PR on its own branch
- **Parent repo is clean** - No submodule references in the parent commit
- **`.claude` is pull-only for nested submodules** - Never include nested submodule pointer changes (nestjs, react, etc.) in `.claude` commit
- **Protected branch = ask and branch** - When on `dev` or `main`, ask user for a branch name, then create and switch to it
- **Generic detection** - Submodules are detected dynamically via `git submodule status`, not hardcoded
- **After merging PR** - Delete the branch to keep repo clean
