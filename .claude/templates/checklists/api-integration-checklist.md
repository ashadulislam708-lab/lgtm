## Framework Compliance Audit Procedure

When using the Framework Compliance Gaps checklist, follow this dynamic detection and audit process:

### Step 1: Detect Active Frameworks

```bash
# Detect backend framework
if [ -f "backend/package.json" ]; then
  rg -l "@nestjs/core" backend/package.json && echo "BACKEND_TIER=nestjs"
fi
if [ -f "backend/requirements.txt" ]; then
  rg -l "Django" backend/requirements.txt && echo "BACKEND_TIER=django"
fi

# Detect frontend frameworks
fd package.json frontend* --max-depth 2 | xargs rg -l "react" && echo "FRONTEND_TIER=react"

# Detect mobile framework
if [ -f "mobile/package.json" ]; then
  rg -l "react-native" mobile/package.json && echo "MOBILE_TIER=react-native"
fi
```

### Step 2: Discover Framework Resources

For each detected `[framework-tier]`, enumerate available resources:

```bash
# List available guides
fd -e md . .claude/[framework-tier]/guides/

# List available skills
fd -e md . .claude/[framework-tier]/skills/

# List available agents
fd -e md . .claude/[framework-tier]/agents/
```

### Step 3: Read Mandatory Guides

Before auditing, read these guides in order:
1. `.claude/[framework-tier]/guides/README.md` - Index of all guides
2. `.claude/[framework-tier]/guides/best-practices.md` - Mandatory patterns
3. `.claude/[framework-tier]/guides/architecture-overview.md` - Structure patterns

### Step 4: Apply Framework-Specific Checklist Items

When auditing, replace placeholders dynamically:

| Placeholder | Backend | Frontend Web | Frontend Mobile |
|-------------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| `[framework-tier]` | nestjs / django | react | react-native |
| `[backend-tier]` | nestjs / django | N/A | N/A |
| `[frontend-tier]` | N/A | react | react-native |

### Step 5: Cross-Reference with Existing Guides

For each gap identified, document:
1. **Guide Reference**: Which guide documents the expected pattern
2. **Current Implementation**: How the code currently implements it
3. **Gap Description**: What specifically doesn't comply
4. **Remediation**: Steps to bring into compliance

### Step 6: Agent Delegation Recommendations

When gaps require implementation changes:
- **Backend gaps** → Delegate to `backend-developer` agent
- **Frontend gaps** → Delegate to `frontend-developer` agent
- **Mobile gaps** → Delegate to `mobile-developer` agent
- **Database gaps** → Delegate to `database-designer` agent
- **Cross-stack gaps** → Handle directly or coordinate multiple agents

## Automated Detection Commands

Use these commands to automatically detect organization and cleanup issues:

### File Organization Detection

```bash
# Find files in unexpected locations (backend)
fd -e ts . backend/src --max-depth 1 --exclude main.ts --exclude app.module.ts

# Find misnamed controllers
fd -e ts . backend/src/modules --type f | rg -v "(controller|service|module|entity|repository|dto)" | head -20

# Find orphan components (not imported anywhere)
for f in $(fd -e tsx . frontend/app/components); do
  rg -l "$(basename $f .tsx)" frontend/app --glob "*.tsx" --glob "*.ts" | wc -l | xargs -I {} test {} -eq 1 && echo "Possibly orphan: $f"
done

# Find empty directories
fd -t d -e '' .
```

### Dummy Data Detection

```bash
# Find hardcoded mock data patterns
rg -n "mockData|dummyData|fakeData|testData" --glob "*.ts" --glob "*.tsx" -g "!*.spec.ts" -g "!*.test.ts" -g "!**/seeds/**" -g "!**/fixtures/**"

# Find placeholder content
rg -n "lorem ipsum|John Doe|jane@example|test@test|placeholder\.com" --glob "*.ts" --glob "*.tsx" -g "!*.spec.ts"

# Find TODO comments about mock data

rg -n "console\.(log|debug|warn|info)" --glob "*.ts" --glob "*.tsx" -g "!*.spec.ts" -g "!*.test.ts"

# Find debugger statements
rg -n "debugger" --glob "*.ts" --glob "*.tsx"

# Find commented code blocks (lines starting with // followed by code-like content)
rg -n "^\s*//\s*(const|let|var|function|class|import|export|if|for|while|return)" --glob "*.ts" --glob "*.tsx"

# Find @ts-ignore without comments
rg -n "@ts-ignore(?!\s+--)" --glob "*.ts" --glob "*.tsx"
```

### File Cleanup Detection

```bash
# Find backup/temp files
fd -e bak -e old -e tmp -e copy -e backup -e temp .

# Find OS-generated files
fd -H "\.DS_Store|Thumbs\.db|desktop\.ini" .

# Find log files
fd -e log .

# Find potentially committed env files
fd -H "^\.env$|^\.env\." . --exclude ".env.example"

# Find node_modules in unexpected places
fd -H -t d "node_modules" . --exclude "node_modules"
```

### Comprehensive Cleanup Report

```bash
# Generate cleanup report
echo "=== CLEANUP REPORT ===" > cleanup-report.txt
echo "" >> cleanup-report.txt

echo "## Backup/Temp Files" >> cleanup-report.txt
fd -e bak -e old -e tmp -e copy . >> cleanup-report.txt
